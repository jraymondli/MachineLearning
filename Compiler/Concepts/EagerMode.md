In the context of compilers, "eager mode" typically refers to a strategy where the compiler evaluates expressions, functions, or optimizations as soon as they are encountered, rather than deferring or delaying these operations until later (like in a "lazy" or deferred evaluation).

### Eager vs. Lazy Evaluation:
- **Eager Evaluation**: In this mode, computations or optimizations are performed immediately when the expressions are encountered. This approach is common in most programming languages, where expressions are evaluated right away, and results are stored. For example, when you assign a value to a variable or call a function, the computation happens immediately.

- **Lazy Evaluation**: In contrast, lazy evaluation delays computation until the value is needed. This can be advantageous in certain cases, such as when dealing with potentially large data structures or when some computations might not need to be executed at all. Languages like Haskell are known for using lazy evaluation by default.

### Eager Mode in Compilers:
For compilers, eager mode could imply:
1. **Immediate Code Optimization**: When compiling code, the compiler might apply optimizations as soon as it identifies opportunities. This can include inlining functions, constant folding (where constants are computed at compile time), or other optimizations that can be determined early in the compilation process.
   
2. **Memory Management**: An eager compiler may allocate memory for variables and data structures as soon as it encounters their declarations, rather than deferring these allocations.

3. **Eager Semantic Analysis**: The compiler might perform semantic analysis (checking the correctness of variable types, scope, etc.) as soon as possible instead of waiting for a later stage in the compilation.

Eager mode is advantageous when the overhead of deferring calculations or optimizations is higher than the cost of computing them immediately. However, it can be less efficient when dealing with large computations or data structures where only a portion might be needed.

In summary, **eager mode** in a compiler context generally means doing as much work as possible upfront. This contrasts with **lazy mode**, where the compiler tries to delay work until it is certain that it is needed. The choice between eager and lazy strategies can affect performance, memory usage, and execution time depending on the nature of the program being compiled.
