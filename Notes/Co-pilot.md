A **copilot** generally refers to a second pilot who assists the main pilot in flying an aircraft. However, in the context of technology and software, **Copilot** often refers to AI-powered tools designed to assist users with various tasks, especially in coding.

For example:

- **GitHub Copilot**: This is an AI tool developed by GitHub and OpenAI that helps software developers by suggesting code snippets, completing code, and even writing entire functions based on the context of the code. It integrates with various IDEs (like Visual Studio Code) and helps streamline coding by offering intelligent autocompletions, reducing the time needed to search for solutions or write repetitive code.

In essence, a "copilot" in tech is like an intelligent assistant that helps you perform tasks more efficiently. What kind of copilot are you referring to, coding or another field?
